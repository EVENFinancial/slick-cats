# Contributing to Slick-Cats
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. There are a few guidelines we need contributors to follow so that we are able to process requests as efficiently as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the maintainers. 

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit the [RMS Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/RMSone/slick-cats)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
 * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
 * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch off of `master` before you start your work.
 * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
 * You may be asked to squash unnecessary commits down to logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages.
* Please follow existing code conventions when working on a file.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository maintained by the RMS organization.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
